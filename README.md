# Banking-Churn-Prediction

Banking Customer Churn Analysis Problem Statement: Despite the continuous efforts of banks to attract and retain customers, the banking industry faces a persistent challenge in the form of customer churn, leading to financial losses and reduced customer satisfaction. It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.

Project Objective: The aim of this project is to analyze the customer churn rate for a bank to understand why customers leave. We will use machine learning to identify key factors that significantly influence customer churn or attrition. The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable model that attaches a probability to churn, making it easier for customer service to target the right customers and minimize efforts to prevent churn.

Project Overview: Churn refers to customers leaving a bank or discontinuing their banking services. Banking Churn Analysis is a process of studying customer behavior in the banking industry to predict and understand customer attrition or churn. Banking Churn Modeling aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn, enabling banks to take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.


Conclusion Key Points: The key factors that significantly influence the deactivation of customers' banking facilities are Total_Products, Age, IsActiveMember, Gender, and Geography. High Training and Testing Accuracies: The 
model's accuracy score near 85% on the testing data suggests its ability to generalize well to unseen instances. High F1 Score, Recall, and Precision: The model achieved high F1 score, recall, and precision values, all 
approximately 0.85. This indicates that the model has a strong ability to correctly identify positive cases while minimizing false positives and maximizing true positives. Overall Model Performance: The model demonstrates 
strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in making accurate predictions and capturing the desired outcomes.
